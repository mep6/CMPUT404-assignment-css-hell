Gutenberg Project HTML File Modifications:
==========================================
* removed from <head> section the inline <style> sections from all three files
* added to <head> section <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="base.css">
* added to 1.html and 3.html <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8"/>; 2.html already had a <meta> tag
* striped out any references to the attribute style and its elements from all 3 files
* in 3.html under images is a icon for enlarging the image, in those <img> tags they had the alt attribute blank, so added text to say what the image is for
